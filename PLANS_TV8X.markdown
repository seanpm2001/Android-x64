# V8 Template plans

## Template V8x

1. Too much disclaimer, try to find out how to do a dropdown (without turning the entire page into a giant text box) or comment some of it out for now λ

2. Mobile version: success, no improvements needed (other than maybe a way to ease navigation and tell where to scroll) λ

3. Repo directory, for description, tags, linked, and url (if none provided, use the "no description websites or URLs provided" that GitHub uses)

4. UTF-7 clarification

5. Swisscows support

6. Safe.duckduckgo support

7. Removal of parantheses in title line

8. Highly advanced .gitattributes, .editorconfig, and .gitignore

9. Google link (but it actually points to DeGoogle, don't be a jerk about it, just call it DeGoogle)

10. Try to find a way to highlight more text or some other catchy way for important info, also clarify what is important λ

11. Bold the text for the file info section headings, and file history section with bold, add support for MIME *.mkd and *.markdown

12. HYBRID TEMPLATE: Mix of GitHub (pages) and Git (repository (normal))

Even better improvement:

THE ULTIMATE GIT TEMPLATE:

13. Separate branches for each template category, fit all your templates into one
