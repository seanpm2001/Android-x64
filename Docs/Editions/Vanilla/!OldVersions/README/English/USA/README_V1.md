# Android x64 Docs

## Editons / Vanilla

### What is Vanilla Edition?

The vanilla edition of Android x64 is a very simple Android build. It is merely just unmodified Android, but it is ported to several CPU architectures, and contains a custom bootloader.

### Architectures

* ARM x64 (Default)
* AMD 86x64
* AMD x64
* Intel 86x64
* Intel x64
* SPARC x64
* Other/unknown

### Bootloader

The bootloader is written in C and Assembly language. It utilizes [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses/) for the installation process, but the splash screen is currently being decided on.

### Frameworks

Candroid is not included in this edition by default, but can be added during the installation process (or the post-installation process)
