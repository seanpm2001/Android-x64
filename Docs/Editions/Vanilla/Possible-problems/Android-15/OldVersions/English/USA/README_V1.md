### Possible Problems / Android 15

I have a feeling there is going to be a problem with this project when Android 15 is released. Since the letter associated with 15 will be V, and since Android codenames itself after desserts, I feel that the codename for Android 15 will be Vanilla. How am I to separate all the Vanilla Editions of this project from Android Vanilla? How do you properly differentiate the terms? Vanilla Android or Vanilla Vanilla Android? Something else? There is sure to be some confusion if this happens.
