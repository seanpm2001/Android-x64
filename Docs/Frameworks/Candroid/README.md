### What is Candroid?

Candroid (pronounced: Can Droid, or Canned Droid, or however you prefer to pronounce it) is a DeGoogled, Free and open source Android framework and busy box by [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) meant to add full Android functionality to Android systems and non-Android systems that run the Linux kernel. It is mostly written in Java, but some portions are written in C. A disputed section is written in the Google Go language.

The project is currently a major work in progress. It is alternatively called C-Droid.

### Applications

Candroid currently contains 25 Java applications, and 1 core Java library. To read more about them, visit the [:octocat: Candroid Catalog](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Candroid-Catalogue/) and the [:octocat: Candroid Docs](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Candroid-Docs/).
