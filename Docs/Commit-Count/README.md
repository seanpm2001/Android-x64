# Commit count for Git-Template_V8

This project has a moderate of commits. Unfortunately, they aren't very accessible.

Each branch has between 30 and 100+ commits, and there are 13 branches (as of 2022, Saturday, April 16th)

Unfortunately, each commit doesn't show up on my profile unless it was done on the edefault branch [`main`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Git-Template_V8/tree/main)
