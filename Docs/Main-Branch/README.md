# Git-Template Docs

## Usage of the main branch

The `main` branch is the landing page for the template itself. For the first 7-9 months of using this template, I normally just deleted the `main` branch and switched to the one I needed. In early 2022, I realized that it was important to preserve the landing page, so I adopted a new protocol.

The `main` branch isn't very useful for the development of a project, but it pinpoints its origin, and is pretty small (less than a megabyte) so why delete it? Since the project is not tagged, keeping the `main` branch is important to easily determine the date of the repository, and the date of the changes.

The way I have been doing it recently is renaming the `main` branch to `Git-Template_Source` then switching to my preferred branch, renaming the preferred branch, then deleting all branches except for `Git-Template_Source` and my preferred branch.
