# Version 8 : Release 2022 May 19th

## V8.2022.05.19

### About

I made some changes to this template today.

Today, I worked on general improvements, and work on issue templates/pull request templates. I also created 2 new branches (`Template-SPM2001-Journaling-Images-GitHub_Yearly` and `Template-SPM2001-Journaling-Images`)

I was able to apply issue template updates to the following branches:

- Template-Other
- Template-SNU-Default
- Template-SPM2001-Journaling-Images
- Template-SPM2001-Journaling-Images-GitHub_Yearly
- Template-SPM2001-Journaling-TW-ELM-V1
- Template-SNU-Other
- Template-SNU-Programming-Tools

However, I made a mistake with some issue template configuration, as I put the wrong template in place for Template-Other, SNU-Default, and SNU-Other, as I was using the Git-image issue template.

For the SNU branches, I added a `desktop.ini` file, and for the programming tools repository, I gave 6 attempts at creating a functional issue template out of the previous one, as I wanted to preserve it. I managed to clear all bugs, then it just failed entirely, giving me 5 errors, and not telling me what they are or where they were. So I gave up for now.

The new GitHub images yearly branch will first be used in 2023. It is going to be used from now on, so I don't have to create 3000+ `IGNORE.md` files manually. I will someday have the deletion automated as well.

The new GitHub images branch is separate from the other journal branch, and will be used purely for Git-image projects. The original one will still be used, it will be used far less frequently now, and will be on the subject of journaling subjects (such as extras, daily articles, and more)

I spent nearly all of my development time on this project today, and I still didn't come close to finishing. I still have other pending features (README improvements, updates to AUTHORS, CREDITS, INSTALL, and desktop.ini files, etc.)

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project.
