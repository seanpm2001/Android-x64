# Version 8 : Release 2022 April 17th

## V8.2022.04.17

### About

I made some changes to this template today.

I only updated the 2 GitHub Pages branches (`template-github-pages-default` & `template-github-pages-langauge`) to include 13 embedded Jekyll themes that come with GitHub. They were added for support and compatibility reasons, and to avoid the site failing if the originals ever went down or had a problem.

Unfortunately, I made a small capitalization error, so you can't easily go between the 2 branches if you are in the `Pages-Themes` / `Pages-themes` directory or deeper.

This was all I had the time for today. I still have other pending features (README improvements, updates to AUTHORS, CREDITS, INSTALL, and desktop.ini files, etc.)

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project.
