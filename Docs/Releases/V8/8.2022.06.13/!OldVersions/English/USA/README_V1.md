# Version 8 : Release 2022 June 13th

## V8.2022.06.13

### About

I made some minor changes to this template today.

I created a separate branch for WacOS, a default development branch. I have been skeptical of updating other branches, as I fear the changes I make are too destructive.

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project.
