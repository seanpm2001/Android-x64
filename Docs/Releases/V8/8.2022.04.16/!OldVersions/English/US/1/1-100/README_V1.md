# Version 8 : Release 2022 April 16th

## V8.2022.04.16

### About

I made some changes to this template today, as a few features have been neglected for a few months.

I updated ALL 13 branches this time. Some branches were still using `FUNDING.yml` instead of `.FUNDING.yml` and missing the `/Pull_Requests/` directory, so I fixed that on specific branches.

On all branches, I added support for the `AUTOMATE2001.yml` todo file, and a `CODEOWNERS` file (valid, with no bugs)
