# Version 8 : Release 2022 April 22nd

## V8.2022.04.22

### About

I made some changes to this template today.

I thought I already updated the Tree World branch (before I created the next monthly repository for this subject tofay), but I didn't. I hope that this update pays off within 2-3 more months.

I made some small changes, adding support for license archives, and a social preview image. Only the [`Template-SPM2001-Journaling-TW-ELM_V1`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Git-Template_V8/tree/Template-SPM2001-Journaling-TW-ELM-V1/) branch was updated today (`main` was updated as well, but it doesn't count)

This was all I had the time for today. I still have other pending features (README improvements, updates to AUTHORS, CREDITS, INSTALL, and desktop.ini files, etc.)

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project.
