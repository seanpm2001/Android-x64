Android x86 is an open source project by developers Chih-Wei Huang and Yi Sun aimed at porting Android to Intel processors, rather than the ARM processor that the upstream Android project is built on.

### Similarities and differences with Android x32, x64, and x128

The Android x64 project only works with 64 bit Android, the Android x32 project only works with 32 bit Android, and Android x128 is reserved for if Android goes 128 bit. The Android x86 project doesn't differentiate this way. Along with this, Android x86 supports certain significant versions of Android, while the Android x32, x64, and x128 projects intend to support every major version of Android in 3 different variants.

Android x32x64x128 is planned to come with LiveCD support in certain editions.
