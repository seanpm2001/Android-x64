// For: Android x64
// About:
// I decided to make Java the 2nd project language file for this project (Android-x64) as the model operating system (Android) heavily uses Java. I feel it is a viable platform, however, this time I may de-emphasize Kotlin. Java is to be used for application prgramming and user interfaces. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
