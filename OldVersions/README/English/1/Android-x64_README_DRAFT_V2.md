### Android x86

Website: [`https://www.android-x86.org/`](https://www.android-x86.org/)

Android x86 is a separate project. It isn't dead, but I have specific needs for my Android setup, and I wanted to go my own way.

While this project is not functional yet, Android x86 is viable for "old" versions of Android (Android 10 and below)

***

## Hosting

Android x64 is hosted on [`archive.org`](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Android-x64%22) and linked to from [`GitHub`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Android-x64/)

Hosting is done there to support the Internet Archive, and also due to limited self-host abilities at the moment.
